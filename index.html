          I have made it so that you can have as many products as you want
          without impacting the page load of the website. This is because the
          iframes don't get loaded before the user clicks on the buy buttons.

          You can also easily embed a widget and it will get loaded immediately.
          If you don't run this after page load and if you have mulitple of
          them, it could seriously impact the page load time. Use them sparsely
          or make use of lazy loading to load them only if they get into the
          user's view.
